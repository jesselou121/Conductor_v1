Prompt 2 of 5: Simplified Process Flow

Based on the process description for producing {{PRODUCT}} from {{FEEDSTOCK}}, create a simplified process flow with the following constraints:

1. Include exactly 6 unit operations in this order:
    1. Auxillary unit operation 1 “Feedstock Handling”: This step takes some raw feedstock input, and applies some basic treatment turning it into a treated feedstock ready for this specific process’s needs
    2. Main unit operation 1: This first main step should convert the treated feedstock into the next intermediate form
    3. Main unit operation 2: This main step bridges between the first intermediate form to the next, where it’s almost ready for conversion into the final form
    4. Main unit operation 3: this last unit operation should convert the intermediate product into the final product given the specifications
    5. Auxillary unit operation 2 “Product storage”: This step only takes the target product as input 
    6. Auxillary unit operation 3 “Waste Disposal”: This step only takes in auxillary outputs from other unit operations related to waste as input
2. Auxillary unit operation 1 “Feedstock Handling” provide:
    1. an identifier: aux_unit_op_1
    2. brief description of its function
    3. define the input stream: raw_biomass (this is provided by a user later)
    4. the calculation for how the raw feedstock should be treated
    5. ignore parameters like temperature, pH)
3. For each main unit operation, provide:
    1. an identifier starting with “main_unit_op”
    2. brief description of its function
    3. Input streams (main streams and auxillary streams)
    4. Output streams - 1 output stream will be related to the eventual target product (main stream). Other critical waste-related output streams should also be defined (auxillary streams).
    5. First, lay out simple calculations related to the auxillary inputs, that impact the main flow coming into the node
    6. Then, lay out the simple calculation that drive the main output flow 
    7. Call out only the most relevant parameters affecting the volumetric flows of the operation; such as conversion rates, loading rates, extraction efficiencies, etc  
    8. ignore parameters like temperature, pH
4. For Auxillary unit operation 2 “Product storage”, provide:
    1. an identifier: aux_unit_op_2
    2. brief description of its function
    3. associate the input to the target product output stream from main unit operation 3
    4. this unit operation has no output and no calculation involved
5. Auxillary unit operation 3 “Waste Disposal”, provide:
    1. an identifier: aux_unit_op_3
    2. brief description of its function
    3. associate the inputs to any relevant waste-related output streams from the other main unit operations
    4. this unit operation has no output and no calculation involved
6. Ensure that streams are properly connected between unit operations.
