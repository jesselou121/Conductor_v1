Prompt 3 of 5: Variable definition

For the simplified process flow in the previous response to produce {{PRODUCT}} from {{FEEDSTOCK}}, define the following variables and parameters:

1. For each stream:
    1. A descriptive name
    2. A variable name in snake_case
    3. The unit of measurement (typically kg/hr)
    4. The type of stream (either 'main' or 'auxiliary')
2. For each parameter:
    1. A variable name in snake_case
    2. A typical value and unit. 
    3. The units for the typical value must be normalized to a fraction, %, or like-to-like unit (e.g., g/g, weight/weight) 
3. For each auxiliary calculation in the unit operation (if any):
    1. A descriptive name for the calculation
    2. The formula using only the variable names of parameters or streams
    3. Formulas should be structured as: variable_name = (formula using main flows, parameters, variables)
4. Then for the main calculation for the specific unit operation:
    1. A descriptive name for the calculation
    2. The formula using only the variable names of parameters or streams
    3. The formula for the calculation are structured in the form of: variable_name = (formula that accounts for the main flow input and other parameters and variables relevant to the calculation) 

In your output, lay out all of the streams first. Then for each unit operation node, lay out information in the following manner:
id: 
name: 
type: (either: main, auxiliary)
inputs:
